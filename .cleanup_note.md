# Repository Cleanup Note

## Completed Actions

✅ **Updated `.gitignore`**
- Added `.out_*/` pattern to exclude all `.out_*` directories
- This prevents future test output directories from being tracked

✅ **Created `.ce3_grammar.json`**
- Defines CE3-level emergent organizational structure
- Establishes compositional growth patterns and attractor fields
- Documents stigmergic markers for self-organizing repository behavior
- Provides overflow rules and flow dynamics

## Remaining Manual Action Required

⚠️ **Remove Tracked `.out_*` Directories**

The following directories need to be removed from the repository:
- `.out_test/`
- `.out_full_test/`
- `.out_report_test/`
- `.out_small/`

These are build artifacts from the benchmark system that were accidentally committed.

### Removal Commands

```bash
# Remove directories from git tracking and filesystem
git rm -rf .out_test
git rm -rf .out_full_test
git rm -rf .out_report_test
git rm -rf .out_small

# Commit the removal
git commit -m "Remove legacy .out_* test output directories

- These are build artifacts that should not be tracked
- Updated .gitignore to prevent future .out_* directories
- Added .ce3_grammar.json defining repository organization patterns"
```

## Rationale

According to CE3 overflow rules defined in `.ce3_grammar.json`:

**test_accumulation overflow:**
> "Trigger: Test output directories (.out_*) created outside standard .out/"
> "Response: Consolidate into .out/ or add to .gitignore as ephemeral artifacts"
> "Stigmergic marker: Pattern recognition and path unification"

The benchmark system already uses `.out/` as the standard output directory (see `benchmarks/ce/synthetic.py:24`), making these `.out_*` variants legacy artifacts that should evaporate.

## CE3 Perspective

From a stigmergic viewpoint:
- **Pheromone evaporation**: Old test outputs should naturally decay
- **Path consolidation**: All output should flow to `.out/` attractor
- **Repository hygiene**: Ephemeral artifacts belong in the ephemeral_cloud, not tracked in git

This cleanup strengthens the coherent path and allows the repository to self-organize according to its natural attractor fields.
