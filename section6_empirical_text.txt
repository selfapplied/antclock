## 6. Experimental Results

### Current Status: Preliminary Implementation

**Important Note**: The following results are from preliminary implementations using small synthetic datasets. Real systematic generalization benchmarks require substantially larger datasets and more extensive evaluation. These results demonstrate framework correctness but should be considered proof-of-concept rather than definitive empirical validation.

### SCAN Systematic Generalization

Current baseline implementation achieves 0.0% accuracy on test sets with systematic generalization patterns. The synthetic dataset contains only ~47 training examples, insufficient for robust neural network training. Real SCAN evaluation requires the full dataset with 21,903 training examples.

**Key Systematic Generalization Patterns Tested:**
- Primitive recursion: "jump jump" → "JUMP JUMP"
- Quantifier composition: "jump twice and turn left" → "JUMP JUMP TURN_LEFT"
- Opposite operations: "turn opposite left" → "TURN_RIGHT"
- Novel combinations: "swim and jump" → "SWIM JUMP"

### COGS Semantic Parsing

Current baseline implementation achieves 0.0% accuracy on semantic parsing tasks. The synthetic dataset contains only ~23 training examples, requiring scale-up to the full COGS dataset for meaningful evaluation.

**Semantic Compositionality Tested:**
- Entity-property relations: "Where was {person} born?"
- Complex queries: "What company does the person work for who lives in {city}?"
- Multi-hop reasoning: "Where does the person live who was born in {city}?"

### PCFG Compositional Grammar

Implemented probabilistic context-free grammar parsing benchmark with CE-enhanced architecture. Tests compositionality in syntactic structure learning through novel grammatical constructions.

### Additional Benchmarks Implemented

- **CFQ**: Compositional Freebase Questions (semantic parsing)
- **RPM**: Raven's Progressive Matrices (visual reasoning)
- **Math Reasoning**: Systematic mathematical pattern completion

### Interpretability Framework

The CE framework provides theoretical enhancements for interpretability:

- **Phase Coherence**: Guardian threshold κ = 0.35 prevents phase locking
- **Geometric Regularization**: Curvature coupling χ_FEG = 0.638 provides flow-based dynamics
- **Symmetry Breaking**: Mirror operators enforce discrete involutions
- **Functional Equations**: Zeta regularization constrains Ξ(s) = Ξ(1-s)

### Recommendations for Full Evaluation

1. **Scale to Real Datasets**: Use official SCAN (21K train), COGS, and PCFG datasets
2. **Extended Training**: Train for 100+ epochs with proper hyperparameter tuning
3. **Ablation Studies**: Systematically evaluate CE components at scale
4. **Multiple Runs**: Report mean/variance across random seeds
5. **Comparison Baselines**: Compare against Transformer, GNN, and other architectures

### Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates the CE framework's architectural soundness and theoretical foundations. Full empirical validation requires scaling to real benchmark datasets and extensive computational resources. The framework shows promise for enhancing systematic generalization through discrete geometric regularization.
