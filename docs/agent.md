label: Agent Stewardship Hierarchy Recognition
kind: lesson
```

### [] memory:
```
stewards:
  run.sh: domain-specific steward (viral immunity, environment management)
  python3 -c: general-purpose steward (bypasses immunological framework)
  make: orchestration steward (coordinates execution pipeline)
  git: persistence steward (version control and history)
```

### {} region:
```
domain: AntClock execution ecosystem
constraint: viral immunity model requires proper immunological integration
boundary: run.sh hashbang convention defines executable namespace
```

### () morphisms:
```
respect_stewardship: run.sh → immunological_execution
bypass_framework: python3 -c → immunological_violation
coordinate_operations: make → pipeline_orchestration
preserve_history: git → accountability_chain
```

### <> witness:
```
lesson: run.sh understands AntClock's viral immunity model

## Zeta Card: Import Architecture Understanding

  relative_imports: from .module import X (fails when run as script)
  absolute_imports: from project.module import X (works consistently)
  run_sh_execution: hashbang routing enables proper module resolution
  direct_python: bypasses run.sh context, requires manual path management
```

### {} region:
```

*These zeta cards document the critical stewardship lessons learned during AntClock benchmarking operations. The viral immunity model teaches us that responsible agency requires understanding and respecting domain-specific execution frameworks, not bypassing them with general-purpose tools.*
